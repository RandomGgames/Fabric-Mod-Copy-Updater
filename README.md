# Fabric Mod Copy Updater

## What does it do?
This is a python script that allows for downloading any mod into one folder (the most up to date folder in config) and copy them into other minecraft mod folders in other directories in order to keep mod versions in sync accross multiple minecraft directories.

## Requirements
 - Python3. Written using v3.9.6, but I'm guessing any python3 will work...? Could be wrong though.

## Planned updates/fixes
- [ ] Make it forge mod compatable too (MAYBE, no promises)
