# Fabric Mod Copy Updater

## What does it do?
This is a python script that allows for downloading any mod into one folder (the most up to date folder in config) and copy them into other minecraft mod folders in other directories in order to keep mod versions in sync accross multiple minecraft directories.

## Requirements
 - Python3. Written using v3.9.6, but I'm guessing any python3 will work...? Could be wrong though.

## How to download
- Click the "Fabric Mod Copy Updater.py" file
- Click the "Raw" button just above the code
- Clicking Ctrl+S should prompt a download for a file called "Fabric Mod Copy Updater.py", otherwise right click and hit save as. If that doesn't prompt that file still, copy the text into a blank file you create using a text editor.
- Run the script once to create a blank config file. Keep these two files in the same folder!
- Instructions for how to set up the config file can be found on the [WIKI](https://github.com/RandomGgames/Fabric-Mod-Copy-Updater/wiki#example-config)

## Planned updates/fixes
- [ ] Make it forge mod compatable too (MAYBE, no promises)
