# Fabric Mod Copy Updater

## What does it do?
This is a python script that allows you to keep your mods in sync with one another from one central folder. What it does is copies a mod from this central location (which you keep updated manually) into other mod directories you might have. This allows you to essentially update a mod in once place and automatically update the same mod into other mod folders.

## How to download
- Click the "Fabric Mod Copy Updater.py" file
- Click the "Raw" button just above the code
- Clicking Ctrl+S should prompt a download for a file called "Fabric Mod Copy Updater.py", otherwise right click and hit save as. If that doesn't prompt that file still, copy the text into a blank file you create using a text editor.
- Run the script once to create a blank config file. Keep these two files in the same folder!
- Instructions for how to set up the config file can be found on the [WIKI](https://github.com/RandomGgames/Fabric-Mod-Copy-Updater/wiki#example-config)

## Requirements
 - Python. Not sure about the minimum version, but I wrote it in v3.9.6 so that works at least. If you test other versions and it works, share in [Discussion]

## Planned updates/fixes
- [ ] Make it forge mod compatable too (MAYBE, no promises)
